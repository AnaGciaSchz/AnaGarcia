Hi, Iâ€™m Ana! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a creative Computer Science Engineer turned into a DevRel enthusiast, blending my love for technology and people into a career Iâ€™m truly passionate about. Based in the beautiful city of GijÃ³n, Asturias (a place I adore!), my journey began while completing my studies at [The School of Computer Engineering](https://ingenieriainformatica.uniovi.es/) at the University of Oviedo.

Throughout my student years, I gained invaluable experience as a student representative, sharpening my teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills. These experiences shaped me into a developer who thrives on collaboration, innovation, and engaging with othersâ€”qualities that are often rare in our field.

What sets me apart is my unique balance between technical expertise and public speaking. I genuinely enjoy diving deep into code as much as I love sharing insights, connecting with the community, and telling stories. Thatâ€™s why I created this pageâ€”itâ€™s not just a portfolio but also a space to share my thoughts, experiences, and tips in the blog section.

Welcome to my corner of the web! ðŸŒŸ

<h3>Student Representation</h3>

My professional journey wouldnâ€™t be complete without highlighting my time in Student Representation. Those years were transformative, pushing me to achieve things I never imaginedâ€”organizing events, traveling, launching new initiatives, managing diverse teams, and even mentoring incoming students.

 I had the honor of being elected president of several university organizations and serving on the board of directors of[RITSI](https://ritsi.org/) during my final yearâ€”a national student representation organization. Though my formal role has ended, I still enjoy contributing by giving talks and supporting projects whenever I can.

These experiences not only shaped my skills and perspective but also brought me lifelong friendshipsâ€”and one very special relationship! I now share my life with an amazing partner and our adorable cat, Tortitas (Spanish for Pancakes ðŸ˜‰).

<h3>Projects</h3>

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects using various programming languages and technologies. At work, my go-to language is Java, but my portfolio spans much more:

* **Final Degree Project**: I built a [full-stack web application](https://github.com/AnaGciaSchz/Heritage) using JavaScript, handling both the frontend and backend development. I also designed the site and drew the logo.
* **Academic Projects**: During my studies, I worked extensively with Python and C#, honing my problem-solving and programming skills.
* **Server and DevOps Experience**: While collaborating with [RITSI](https://ritsi.org/), I managed servers and worked with technologies like PHP, WordPress, and Docker.
* **Collaborative Projects**: I also contributed to two team projects using [SOLID](https://solid.mit.edu/), exploring the future of decentralized data ownership.

<h4>Recent Highlights</h4>

One of my most exciting recent projects involved Docker. My goal was to encapsulate the [Empathy Platform](https://docs.empathy.co/) earch product into a Docker container, creating a streamlined setup that allowed users to get a working version up and running within minutes.

This project wasnâ€™t just about technical implementationâ€”I also focused on making the solution user-friendly by enabling easy customization and providing comprehensive resources like documentation and tutorials. The result? The [Empathy Self-Managed Components](https://docs.empathy.co/understand-empathy-platform/about-empathy-platform/self-managed-components-overview.html). You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/empathyco/empathy-self-managed-components)

<h3>Software Engineering and DevRel</h3>

My career began as a Backend Engineer, starting with an internship and quickly growing by diving deep into the product. I progressed from creating demos to joining the search team, eventually setting up new clients independently. Throughout this time, my passion for public speaking and documentation was evident, and when I delivered my first international talk, I realized I had found my calling.

I continued to refine my skills, focusing on privacy research and collaborating with my teammates to shape [Visible Privacy](https://visibleprivacy.com/). This experience broadened my perspective and further fueled my drive to connect technology with people.

All of this work led to a pivotal moment: becoming the companyâ€™s first DevRel. In this role, Iâ€™ve embraced a variety of responsibilities, from generating content and developing marketing strategies to leading projects and editing videos. Each challenge has been an opportunity to growâ€”and Iâ€™m excited to see whatâ€™s next on this incredible journey!

<h3>Hobbies</h3>

Iâ€™m currently taking theatre classes, and Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on three productions so far. Recently, I even landed a role in a professional theatre representation as an actressâ€”an experience that has been both challenging and rewarding.

In my free time, I enjoy painting, a hobby Iâ€™ve recently picked up again, and coding personal projects just for fun. Iâ€™ve also started going to the gym regularly, and one of my proudest recent achievements is overcoming my fear of riding a bike!

When Iâ€™m not busy with these activities, you can usually find me taking long walks, exploring cozy cafÃ©s, or catching up with friends. I also used to play role-playing games and still have a fondness for those creative adventures.

<h3>What is 'anuskuskus'?</h3>

Itâ€™s my nickname! One of my favorite teachers gave it to me back in school, and it stuck. Over time, I started using it for my social media accounts, and now some people even call me that in real life. My boyfriend thought it was unique enough to buy this domain for meâ€”so why not embrace it?

Fun fact: Sometimes, websites flag it as containing bad words (I promise itâ€™s harmless!), so I have to settle for using 'kuskus' instead. Life of a quirky nickname, I guess! :')

Hello! I'm Ana, and this is my webpage. Here, I will write blog posts about the things I do or the things I think. 

This page is the "About me" section, so if you want to know more about me, this is your place!

<h3>Introduction</h3>
I'm 24 years old, but despite being young, I have worked in tech for almost three years. I enjoy being a Software Engineer and designing systems, but I also love speaking in public and writing on social media, so I always try to balance those two sides of me.

<h3>Where I'm from</h3>
I'm from Asturias, Spain. I have lived in Gij√≥n my whole life and love this city.

<h3>Education and experience</h3>
I finished my Degree in Software Engineering a year ago in [The School of Computer Engineering](https://ingenieriainformatica.uniovi.es/) at the University of Oviedo.

During those years, I participated in student representation, being the president of some organizations during my last years at the University. I also participated in student representation organizations, like [RITSI](https://ritsi.org/), being part of the board of directors during my last year there. I sometimes still participate by giving talks or helping with projects.

Those experiences gave me confidence in communicating with the team and directing projects. I also learned much about public speaking and getting many people to understand an idea.

<h3>Projects</h3>
I have created projects using a wide variety of programming languages. I usually use Java at work, but I also used Javascript for my final degree project (a webpage where I created the frontend and backend parts) and Python and C# during the degree. I also had to manage servers and work with PHP, WordPress and Docker while on RITSI.

Apart from that, I have created two projects with some teammates using [SOLID](https://solid.mit.edu/).

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
I'm currently taking theatre classes! I also like painting (an old hobby I'm getting back into), and sometimes I go play volleyball with friends (I'm not good, but I give my best).

I also like taking walks, going to cafeterias and meeting friends. I played role games in the past, too!

<h3>What is 'anuskuskus'?</h3>
That's my nickname. One of my favourite teachers gave it to me in school, and I started using it for social media. Sometimes, people refer to me as it, so my boyfriend bought this domain for me. It is unique; why not use it?

Fun fact: sometimes, I can't use it on pages because the algorithms detect bad words on it... So I have to use 'kuskus' instead :')

<h3>How to contact me</h3>
I am active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anagciaschz/), so If you want to reach me quickly, that's the best place to go :) I'm open to talking about anything, so if you are curious about a project, post or want to know me better, I'll be happy to answer.

You can reach me in Spanish or English, and we can give it a try to communicate in Asturian if you want!

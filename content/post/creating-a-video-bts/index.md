Fake it till you make it! I want to start recording and editing videos, so this is my first attempt 😁 

I participated in an internal video for my company, and I thought it might be interesting to show you the process. As you can see, recording is not always glamorous.

Some people believe that I'm good at public speaking, so if you are a person who wants to start doing recordings and talking, but is afraid to start, I hope this video shows you that sometimes you just need to have the initiative... and a cider bottle 😬

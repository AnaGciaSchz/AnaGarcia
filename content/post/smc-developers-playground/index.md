Imagine having the capabilities of a sophisticated search platform right at your fingertips, ready to mold to your exact needs. That's exactly what I’ve been working on for the past months. That’s what the new Self-Managed Components offer. That’s what I’m sharing on this first official blog post.

Today, I'll take you through the different capabilities of Empathy Platform’s new SmC, highlighting what makes it special. Plus, I'll introduce you to some fantastic tutorials that we created! 

<h3>What are the Self-managed Components?</h3>

SmC is a package that includes essential features and tools from the Empathy Platform. It's designed to be:

* **Lightweight and easy to deploy**, thanks to Docker.
* **Privacy-compliant**, like the real Empathy Platform product.
* **Flexible and customizable**, so you can experiment with it.

With SmC, anyone can deploy, test, and customize a basic version of Empathy Platform's privacy-minded experiences on their own infrastructure!

<h3>Key Features of SmC</h3>

The SmC package has powerful features:

* Core search capabilities like [Related Tags](https://docs.empathy.co/understand-empathy-platform/search-features/related-tags-overview.html), [Next Queries](https://docs.empathy.co/understand-empathy-platform/search-features/next-queries-overview.html), [Empathize](https://docs.empathy.co/understand-empathy-platform/search-features/popular-searches-overview.html), and [Top Clicked](https://docs.empathy.co/understand-empathy-platform/search-features/product-recommendations/top-products-overview.html).

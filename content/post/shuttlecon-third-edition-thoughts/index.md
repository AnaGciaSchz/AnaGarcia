This Third Edition of ShuttleCon has been full of surprises. For my side, I wanted to make a more professional event with details, merchandising and bigger communications.

As always, some things did work, and others didn't, but everyone smiled and said, "Thank you" when the event ended.

The most important thing was that all the speakers were happy. [Pablo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablocanalsuarez/) and I wanted this event to be the first step for people to start giving speeches about what they are doing. Many people are incredible, and you can lose track of time just by listening to them.

One edition has passed, but the next one is going to be even better ;) Maybe you could participate in it...

PD: I want the resources we created to be remembered, so here I leave the whole video we put at the start of the event.

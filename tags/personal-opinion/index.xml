&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a well-established fact that human moderation is a crucial element in developing respectful generative AI, especially when the model is trained with internet information. However, what often remains unknown are the exact conditions of the workers involved in this process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In January, Time published their &lt;a class="link" href="https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>exclusive investigation&lt;/a>, showing that OpenAI outsourced this work to Sama, an &amp;rsquo;ethical AI&amp;rsquo; company with Kenyan workers tasked with reviewing and labeling content for less than $2 per hour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This information is controversial, and it becomes even more disturbing when you read the article and discover that OpenAI paid Sama $12.5 per hour for the work. At the same time, their Kenyan workers reported suffering psychological trauma from being exposed to disturbing content, and the sessions with &amp;lsquo;wellness&amp;rsquo; counselors were ineffective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Human intervention is crucial to developing AI, but AI must be ethical. Creating a system that includes precarious working conditions loses its moral aspect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not exclusive to OpenAI or Sama. Employing Indian workers to do tasks like reviewing information is something we could also see in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-just-walk-out-actually-1-000-people-in-india-2024-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Just Walk Out feature from Amazon&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, the AI supply chain is real, and AI is the future. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean everything is okay when creating AI. International Workers&amp;rsquo; Day is commemorated in every part of the world, and we must also ensure that we work in the right conditions in every part of the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want true ethical AIs in my future.&lt;/p>

For my side, I wanted to make a more professional event with details, merchandising and bigger communications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always, some things did work, and others didn&amp;rsquo;t, but everyone smiled and said, &amp;ldquo;Thank you&amp;rdquo; when the event ended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most important thing was that all the speakers were happy. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablocanalsuarez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Pablo&lt;/a> and I wanted this event to be the first step for people to start giving speeches about what they are doing. Many people are incredible, and you can lose track of time just by listening to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One edition has passed, but the next one is going to be even better ;) Maybe you could participate in it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PD: I want the resources we created to be remembered, so here I leave the whole video we put at the start of the event.&lt;/p>

>Christian Peláez&lt;/a>, who casually starts a conversation inviting you to participate in a decentralized project for fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? Because, as many people, when he entered his Instagram account some days ago, he was prompted with the message that you can prevent Meta from using your data for ads&amp;hellip; if you pay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not going to share my opinion, at least for now, but it is similar to the one Christian had when he deleted the app and decided to learn more about the Fediverse and try it with friends (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonia-garc%C3%ADa-lavandera-30634b206/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Sonia García&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniferna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Daniel Fernández&lt;/a> too!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is the Fediverse? What does decentralization mean? To explain it, it is easier if you know Mastodon, one of the social media alternatives people found when Elon Musk bought Twitter, and the world seemed to end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mastodon is a decentralized alternative for microblogging (like Twitter). It is decentralized the same way as e-mail is. Anyone can sign up on any server, talk to other users (in the same server or another), and even have their own server deployed at home. The data is not centralized in servers from just one company; anyone can control their data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Federation is a form of decentralization. And the Fediverse is a set of federated social networks (Federated + Universe). But they also have another thing in common: they use the same open protocol to communicate with the servers and clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does it mean? They can be connected. And they can interact between them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Fediverse is massive. Their technology is better than the centralized ones because their code is free (as in freedom), so anybody can see it and add features. That&amp;rsquo;s why Mastodon lets you have custom emojis, thumbnail crop control, and the much-loved animated avatars Twitter had years ago.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So feel free to try new social media and take control over your data, or create a new project to add to the Fediverse. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave here some alternatives you can check ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Decentralized communication (Like Discord or Slack): &lt;a class="link" href="https://matrix.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Matrix&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Federated image-sharing platform (Like Instagram): &lt;a class="link" href="https://pixelfed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Pixelfed&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alternative to big tech video platforms (Like YouTube): &lt;a class="link" href="https://joinpeertube.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>PeerTube&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mastodon&lt;/a> (of course)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Social platform to enjoy and share music: &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.funkwhale.audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Funkwhale&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More in &lt;a class="link" href="https://fediverse.party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

That person has to explain things very clearly and dynamically to avoid distracting me, which is rare.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know this doesn&amp;rsquo;t just happen to me. Some studies indicate that attention cannot be maintained for an hour. Fifteen minutes is optimal. Therefore, not everything works when giving a talk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am very critical of my work, and if this happens to me with other speakers, I assume that the same thing can occur to other people with me. I am not interested in giving talks or training so dense and complete that only someone who already knows about the topic I am talking about would be able to understand. There are other formats for this, such as publishing on a blog or recording a video. A talk is more interactive since the speaker is in the same room as you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, I always try to adapt the content. But adapting doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean limiting yourself to giving 15-minute talks. There is another alternative: gamification. Kahoot, Mentimeter, a Miro board, real-time surveys&amp;hellip; anything that is interactive and helps maintain interest works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I like to experiment, from time to time, I invest time in researching or thinking about some of these activities from scratch. And last week, I found a page full of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Flippity is a website full of free resources for generating activity pages. You can create a table with a ranking of scores, a trivia, a quick typing contest with personalized texts, your own wordle&amp;hellip; and it allows you to configure everything from a Google spreadsheet: &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>flippity.net&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each resource has a demo to see the final result before implementation and instructions to download the template and generate your page. Additionally, Flippity does not require you to enter any personal information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, if you are also interested in adapting your talks and activities to a more interactive format, I recommend that you save this page in your favourites ;)&lt;/p>

A man in a wheelchair came to speak to us and said a phrase that touched me very deeply. &amp;ldquo;I had a car accident. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m like this now. I saw accidents happen when I was young, but I never thought it would happen to me. I always thought these things only happened to the rest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Focusing on your routine and thinking everything will be like this is straightforward. See news about the bad things that happen in the world and calm yourself, thinking this will not happen to you. And I don&amp;rsquo;t think it isn&amp;rsquo;t good either. It&amp;rsquo;s a way to cope with everyday life. The problem is when something that happened to others happens to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I often think about posting on social media, sharing things I like or interacting with people I like. But I know there is a risk in that, and thanks to that high school talk, I know it can happen to me. Receiving harassment on social networks as a woman is not something unusual, and I would be lying if I said that I had not received more than one message or photograph that I did not want to see. But receiving harassment in the tech world when you are a woman who spreads these topics&amp;hellip; is even more common.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday, I saw a post from a girl on Twitter who usually talks about cybersecurity. She included screenshots of unpleasant comments. They spoke of her body, about how poorly she explained it, about how &amp;ldquo;little idea&amp;rdquo; she had about the subject… Watching her talk, I saw she had the same idea as other content creators, but as I wrote, they are other content creatOrs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this post, I do not want to invite reflection; reflecting will not change the situation. With this post, I want to lay my first stone. I will post more on social media and talk about what I like. And if I start with a post as sincere as this one, talking about other less personal topics won&amp;rsquo;t be so difficult for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After all, good things also happen to the rest, right?&lt;/p>

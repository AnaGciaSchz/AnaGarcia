However, what often remains unknown are the exact conditions of the workers involved in this process.\nIn January, Time published their exclusive investigation, showing that OpenAI outsourced this work to Sama, an \u0026rsquo;ethical AI\u0026rsquo; company with Kenyan workers tasked with reviewing and labeling content for less than $2 per hour.\nThis information is controversial, and it becomes even more disturbing when you read the article and discover that OpenAI paid Sama $12.5 per hour for the work. At the same time, their Kenyan workers reported suffering psychological trauma from being exposed to disturbing content, and the sessions with \u0026lsquo;wellness\u0026rsquo; counselors were ineffective.\nHuman intervention is crucial to developing AI, but AI must be ethical. Creating a system that includes precarious working conditions loses its moral aspect.\nThis is not exclusive to OpenAI or Sama. Employing Indian workers to do tasks like reviewing information is something we could also see in the Just Walk Out feature from Amazon:\nIn the end, the AI supply chain is real, and AI is the future. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean everything is okay when creating AI. International Workers\u0026rsquo; Day is commemorated in every part of the world, and we must also ensure that we work in the right conditions in every part of the world.\nI want true ethical AIs in my future.\nOriginal post on LinkedIn here\nImage from @ana_valdi on Twitter here\n","date":"2024-05-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://anuskuskus.me/p/i-want-true-ethical-ais-in-my-future/cover_hu3118617829241497290.jpg","permalink":"https://anuskuskus.me/p/i-want-true-ethical-ais-in-my-future/","title":"I want true ethical AIs in my future"},{"content":"Fake it till you make it!

That was my first question when deciding on a technology for my comment section on posts.\nAs they say on their website, cusdis.com:\nCusdis is an open-source, lightweight, privacy-first alternative to Disqus. It\u0026rsquo;s super easy to use and integrate with your existing website. We don\u0026rsquo;t track you and your users.\u0026quot;\nAnd what is Disqus? It\u0026rsquo;s a commonly used commenting system on various websites and online communities, allowing users to comment on anything and participate in blog discussions.\nOf course, as a proud developer at Open Innovation in Privacy, when I discovered that there was a commenting technology similar to one of the most popular ones but with a commitment to user privacy, I had to choose it.\nHow to host it? At first, I assumed I needed to host the technology by myself, but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case.\nCusdis offers a free plan to host one site and manually moderate up to one hundred comments per month, with an additional ten comments that can be moderated automatically. You can also pay $5/month for unlimited sites and moderation features.\nHow to set it up? When registering on Cusdis, you can generate a board for your site and get all the necessary information.\nThe platform gives you the embedded code you need to set it up:\nIf you are using the same template as me on your website, you can take the id from that embedded code (the data-app-id value) and put it in the configuration (on config/_default(params.toml):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ## Comments [comments] enabled = true provider = \u0026#34;cusdis\u0026#34; [comments.cusdis] host = \u0026#34;https://cusdis.com\u0026#34; id = \u0026#34;pasteTheIdHere\u0026#34; How does it work? The comments can be anonymous, as users can opt for a random username each time they engage. To maintain a positive and safe environment, comments aren\u0026rsquo;t published immediately.\nAs the page owner, you can moderate them through the dashboard:\nAnd don\u0026rsquo;t worry about knowing when a user comments on your page. Cusdis will alert you via e-mail ;)\nConclusion If you are looking for a commenting system, give it a try to this privacy-first alternative.

Because, as many people, when he entered his Instagram account some days ago, he was prompted with the message that you can prevent Meta from using your data for ads\u0026hellip; if you pay.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to share my opinion, at least for now, but it is similar to the one Christian had when he deleted the app and decided to learn more about the Fediverse and try it with friends (Sonia Garc√≠a and Daniel Fern√°ndez too!).\nWhat is the Fediverse? What does decentralization mean? To explain it, it is easier if you know Mastodon, one of the social media alternatives people found when Elon Musk bought Twitter, and the world seemed to end.\nMastodon is a decentralized alternative for microblogging (like Twitter). It is decentralized the same way as e-mail is. Anyone can sign up on any server, talk to other users (in the same server or another), and even have their own server deployed at home. The data is not centralized in servers from just one company; anyone can control their data.\nFederation is a form of decentralization. And the Fediverse is a set of federated social networks (Federated + Universe). But they also have another thing in common: they use the same open protocol to communicate with the servers and clients.\nWhat does it mean? They can be connected. And they can interact between them.\nThe Fediverse is massive. Their technology is better than the centralized ones because their code is free (as in freedom), so anybody can see it and add features. That\u0026rsquo;s why Mastodon lets you have custom emojis, thumbnail crop control, and the much-loved animated avatars Twitter had years ago.\nSo feel free to try new social media and take control over your data, or create a new project to add to the Fediverse. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave here some alternatives you can check ;)\nDecentralized communication (Like Discord or Slack): Matrix Federated image-sharing platform (Like Instagram): Pixelfed Alternative to big tech video platforms (Like YouTube): PeerTube Mastodon (of course) Social platform to enjoy and share music: Funkwhale More in FediverseParty Original post on LinkedIn here\n","date":"2023-11-20T00:00:00Z","image":"https://anuskuskus.me/p/discovering-fediverse/cover_hu15686742700098980038.jpg","permalink":"https://anuskuskus.me/p/discovering-fediverse/","title":"Discovering Fediverse"},{"content":"I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy sitting for an hour and giving my full attention to someone simply talking. That person has to explain things very clearly and dynamically to avoid distracting me, which is rare.\nI know this doesn\u0026rsquo;t just happen to me. Some studies indicate that attention cannot be maintained for an hour. Fifteen minutes is optimal. Therefore, not everything works when giving a talk.\nI am very critical of my work, and if this happens to me with other speakers, I assume that the same thing can occur to other people with me. I am not interested in giving talks or training so dense and complete that only someone who already knows about the topic I am talking about would be able to understand. There are other formats for this, such as publishing on a blog or recording a video. A talk is more interactive since the speaker is in the same room as you.\nTherefore, I always try to adapt the content. But adapting doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean limiting yourself to giving 15-minute talks. There is another alternative: gamification. Kahoot, Mentimeter, a Miro board, real-time surveys\u0026hellip; anything that is interactive and helps maintain interest works.\nSince I like to experiment, from time to time, I invest time in researching or thinking about some of these activities from scratch. And last week, I found a page full of them.\nFlippity is a website full of free resources for generating activity pages. You can create a table with a ranking of scores, a trivia, a quick typing contest with personalized texts, your own wordle\u0026hellip; and it allows you to configure everything from a Google spreadsheet: flippity.net\nEach resource has a demo to see the final result before implementation and instructions to download the template and generate your page. Additionally, Flippity does not require you to enter any personal information.\nSo, if you are also interested in adapting your talks and activities to a more interactive format, I recommend that you save this page in your favourites ;)\nOriginal post (in Spanish) on LinkedIn here\n","date":"2023-11-13T00:00:00Z","image":"https://anuskuskus.me/p/flippity-as-gamification-tool/cover_hu12191992808030768135.jpg","permalink":"https://anuskuskus.me/p/flippity-as-gamification-tool/","title":"Flippity as gamification tool"},{"content":"I remember the day they came to give us the road safety talk at the institute. A man in a wheelchair came to speak to us and said a phrase that touched me very deeply. \u0026ldquo;I had a car accident. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m like this now. I saw accidents happen when I was young, but I never thought it would happen to me. I always thought these things only happened to the rest.\u0026rdquo;\nFocusing on your routine and thinking everything will be like this is straightforward. See news about the bad things that happen in the world and calm yourself, thinking this will not happen to you. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think it isn\u0026rsquo;t good either. It\u0026rsquo;s a way to cope with everyday life. The problem is when something that happened to others happens to you.\nI often think about posting on social media, sharing things I like or interacting with people I like. But I know there is a risk in that, and thanks to that high school talk, I know it can happen to me. Receiving harassment on social networks as a woman is not something unusual, and I would be lying if I said that I had not received more than one message or photograph that I did not want to see. But receiving harassment in the tech world when you are a woman who spreads these topics\u0026hellip; is even more common.\nYesterday, I saw a post from a girl on Twitter who usually talks about cybersecurity. She included screenshots of unpleasant comments. They spoke of her body, about how poorly she explained it, about how \u0026ldquo;little idea\u0026rdquo; she had about the subject‚Ä¶ Watching her talk, I saw she had the same idea as other content creators, but as I wrote, they are other content creatOrs.\nWith this post, I do not want to invite reflection; reflecting will not change the situation. With this post, I want to lay my first stone. I will post more on social media and talk about what I like. And if I start with a post as sincere as this one, talking about other less personal topics won\u0026rsquo;t be so difficult for me.\nAfter all, good things also happen to the rest, right?\nOriginal post (in Spanish) on LinkedIn here\n","date":"2023-11-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://anuskuskus.me/p/starting-to-post/cover_hu4045687114741988135.jpg","permalink":"https://anuskuskus.me/p/starting-to-post/","title":"Starting to post"},{"content":"The mission of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) revolves around ensuring that the organisation processes the personal data of its staff, customers, providers or any other individuals in compliance with the applicable data protection rules.\nThis responsibility requires a deep understanding of the organisation‚Äôs operations, so communication with the different teams is critical but also challenging.\nDPOs often find themselves uninvolved in product updates and are told late about them. It leads to quick adjustments to Privacy notices, incorrect Cookie banners, inaccurate Consent Paths and more.\nThat harms the DPO and those who use the products. DPOs must know about the products, technical setup and developments, but they must also work with legal, marketing, engineering teams and data scientists.\nBig problems require big solutions, so we are working on our Privacy Deck: tools that help DPOs quickly know the reality of their products and whole teams working across departments to raise responsibility and transparency to transfer the results to customers confidently.\nHere‚Äôs a summary of how these tools can transform your daily life as a Data Protection Officer:\nCMP Analyser: When you land on a webpage, you see a banner that asks you for consent. That banner must be accurate, and accepting or declining must make a difference. With this tool, you can test that accuracy and respect to the user. If you are in charge of the site‚Äôs data protection, you can use it to rectify any errors. MarTech Atlas: Using CMP Analyzer, we could show the names of the cookies and expect you to understand them without context, but we don‚Äôt do things like that. With this tool, we have a database of the cookies, their vendor and their purpose. A DPO can automatically know which data the organisation uses in reality and how it uses it. Play Data Officer: Data doesn‚Äôt have to be boring. That‚Äôs why we also created this dashboard with two main sections to see and interact with the information: Consent Explorer: A view that categorises cookies by the stages at which they appear, followed by some metrics about accuracy, consistency,\u0026hellip; It also offers the option to edit the information if needed. ePrivacy Hub: A view with a summary of the metrics from the last analysis of cookies. It lets you compare the current results with the last one. eStress Tests: With all the information above, we generate a comprehensive examination that includes checking for trackers, calls to third-party services and other potential privacy risks. Besides, it provides valuable feedback highlighting areas where a DPO can improve user data protection.
